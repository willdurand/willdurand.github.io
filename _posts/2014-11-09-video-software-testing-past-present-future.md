Last month, I gave a talk on software testing at [Forum PHP 2014][] in Paris,
organized by the french foundation of French speaking PHP users
([AFUP](https://afup.org/home)). Then again, congratulations to the team, this
event was a blast! (As usual, I would say :-))

In this talk, I gave an overview of what software testing was, describing three
different periods: past, present, and future, hence the title of this talk.

You will find the video of my talk below (in French, sorry):

And, here are my slides:
