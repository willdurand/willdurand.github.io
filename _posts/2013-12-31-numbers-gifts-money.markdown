In **5** hours, a new year will start, **2014**. But, let's take a look at
**2013** first.

I wrote **15** articles, including this one. This is lesser than the year
before (**18**) whereas one of my **2013**'s goals was to blog more... However,
more than **70.000** unique visitors read my thoughts. That is really amazing!
Even better, on Tuesday, July 30, 2013, [From STUPID to SOLID
Code!](/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/)'s publication date, this website
attracted **6000** unique visitors.

The **3** most viewed posts have been [From STUPID to SOLID
Code!](/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/) (**20.652**), [On Open Sourcing
Libraries](/2013/07/04/on-open-sourcing-libraries/) (**11.779**), and [DDD with
Symfony2: Folder Structure And Code
First](/2013/08/07/ddd-with-symfony2-folder-structure-and-code-first/)
(**9.035**). It is worth mentioning that [REST APIs with Symfony2: The Right
Way](/2012/08/02/rest-apis-with-symfony2-the-right-way/) got **59.723** unique
visitors this year, even if this article has been written in **2012**.

These **3** blog posts talk about **Open Source**, and **web development**.
Today, I must confess that I am not a PHP/web developer, I am not even a
developer. I am a PhD student. My daily job is related to industrial computing
and software testing. I don't do programming, and if I would have to, I would
use C#/.NET.
I met people at SymfonyCon Warsaw who didn't understand these facts, and/or why
I was doing so many things for the community, but never for my own business. It
is obviously well-accepted to opensource things that have been created at work,
but not to contribute to open source on his spare time, just for fun.
I thought quite a lot about these questions, and I am still not sure to know
the right answer, so let me rephrase the problem: **who** would do that
otherwise? It is an open-ended question.

Talking about Open Source, [Geocoder](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder)
reached **1200**+ stargazers, while
[Negotiation](https://github.com/willdurand/Negotiation) has been installed
more that **116.000** times, and
[BazingaJsTranslationBundle](https://github.com/willdurand/BazingaJsTranslationBundle)
has been installed more than **77.000** times, meaning it is my most used
bundle under [my GitHub account](https//github.com/willdurand) ("my" most used
bundle would actually be
[FOSJsRoutingBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSJsRoutingBundle)).
My next most installed project will probably be:
[JsonpCallbackValidator](https://github.com/willdurand/JsonpCallbackValidator).
Also, [Anchorify.js](https://github.com/willdurand/anchorify.js) is my most
starred JavaScript library.

According to this [list](https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/2657075), I am the
**47**th most active GitHub user. _Cool story, bro._ Anyway, all this Open
Source work takes time and costs energy. So, next time you wonder why I am doing
all of this without being rewarded or without using it myself, please don't ask!

I am rewarded all the time. Most of the time because people use my stuff, and
sometimes, they are even happy with them! I receive emails or tweets with kind
words every week. This is really great, and so rewarding! This year, I tweeted
my [Amazon Wish
List](http://www.amazon.fr/registry/wishlist/3ICJE3SIOIDWE), and I had the
pleasure to receive gifts for Christmas:

In no particular order, I would like to thank
[Pascal](https://twitter.com/pborreli),
[Ryan](https://twitter.com/weaverryan),
[Leanna](https://twitter.com/leannapelham),
[Lukas](https://twitter.com/lsmith),
[Mathias](https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes),
[Antoine](https://twitter.com/toin0u), and [Hubert](https://twitter.com/youb_s)
for these awesome gifts!

As of now, I would be very grateful if you would support my work via
[Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/willdurand) or
[Flattr](https://flattr.com/profile/willdurand), but remember that I also love
to receive emails.
I know that money in Open Source is always a tricky point. Be sure that I won't
get paid twice for the Open Source work I am doing. I am not sponsored by
anyone, and over the last **3** years, I never asked for money. I don't need
money to create new projects, or to maintain them. However, domain names, GitHub
account, and so on, are not free ;-)

Next year, I will probably continue my Open Source stuff, and I will try to
learn more things. I have new ideas to improve REST support in PHP/Symfony, but
I would also love to expand my knowledge with new languages. Why not bringing my
knowledge into a new community? Who knows.
I also have a lot of books to read, and I promise to write a review for each
book I receive.

On a personal plan, I lost **15** kilograms in **2013**. I changed my way of
life. I don't drink alcohol anymore (I am not an alcoholic, I just stopped drinking
beers and so on during parties or dinners). I try to eat less meat, in order to
become a [flexitarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-vegetarianism). I feel way
better.
I also do a lot of sport, mainly running, mountain biking, squash, and soccer. I
have three goals for **2014**:

* running **10** kilometers in less than **40** minutes;
* swimming faster, and better (~**2**kms);
* competing in a triathlon.

My other goals for **2014** are:

* reading more books;
* writing more, maybe trying to write a book;
* speaking more at conferences;
* improving my English;
* dominating the world.

I wish you a Happy New Year, and all the best for your family, and you! See you
next year!

Thank you &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;
