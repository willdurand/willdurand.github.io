_Today is my sixth Moziversary üéÇ I joined Mozilla as a full-time employee on
May 1st, 2018. I previously blogged in ~~2019~~, [2020][], [2021][], [2022][],
and [2023][]._

Last year, I mainly contributed to Firefox for Android as the lead engineer on a
project called "Add-ons General Availability (GA)". The goal was to allow for
more add-ons on this platform. Success! [More than a thousand extensions are now
available on Android][amo-android] üéâ

In addition, I worked on a Firefox feature called [Quarantined Domains][] and
implemented a new abuse report form on [addons.mozilla.org][] (AMO) to comply
with the Digital Services Act (DSA). I was also involved in two other cross-team
efforts related to the Firefox installation funnel. I investigated various
issues (_e.g._ this [openSUSE bug][suse]), and I coordinated the deprecation of
[weak add-on signatures][weak-sig] and some more changes around certificates
lately, which is why I wrote [xpidump][].

Phew! There is no shortage of work.

When I moved to the WebExtensions team in 2022, [I wrote about this incredible
challenge][new-team]. I echoed this sentiment several months later in my [2022
Moziversary update][2022]. I couldn't imagine how much I would achieve in two
years...

Back then, I didn't know what the next step in my career would be. I have been
aiming to bridge the gap between the AMO and WebExtensions engineering teams
since at least [2021][] and that _is_ my "next step".

I recently took a new role as Add-ons Tech Lead. This is the continuation of
what I've been doing for some time but that comes with new challenges and
opportunities as well. We'll see how it goes but I am excited!

I'll be forever grateful to my manager and coworkers. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
