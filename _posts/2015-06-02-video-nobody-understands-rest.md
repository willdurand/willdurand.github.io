Last month, I gave a talk on why nobody understands REST at [PHP Tour Luxembourg
2015][phptour-2015]. It is not quite right to say "nobody" understands _X_, no
matter the topic. The title of this talk is definitely catchy!

The aim of this presentation was to explain how complicated REST was, and
describe why it was impractical in real life (with concrete examples). I also
gave some ideas to build powerful and pragmatic web APIs.

As usual, congratulations to the AFUP team, this event was a blast!

You will find the video of my talk below (in French, sorry):
