Last month, I gave a talk about REST and Symfony at [PHP Tour Lyon
2014](https://event.afup.org/phptourlyon2014__programme/), organized by the
french foundation of French speaking PHP users ([AFUP](https://afup.org/home)).
Congratulations to the team, this event was a blast!

You will find the video of my talk below (in French, sorry):

I used the
[symfony-rest-edition](https://github.com/gimler/symfony-rest-edition) and
[Propilex](https://github.com/willdurand/Propilex) projects for the demos.
