Last month, I gave a talk on REST and Symfony at [PHP Tour Lyon
2014](http://afup.org/pages/phptourlyon2014/index.php), organized by the french
foundation of French speaking PHP users
([AFUP](http://www.afup.org/pages/site/)). Congratulations to the team, this
event was a blast!

You will find the video of my talk (in French, sorry) below:

And, here are my slides:

I used the
[symfony-rest-edition](https://github.com/gimler/symfony-rest-edition) and
[Propilex](https://github.com/willdurand/Propilex) projects for the demos.
