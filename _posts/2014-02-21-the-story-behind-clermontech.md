One year ago, Julien, Pierre, Manuel, Jean-Philippe, Julien (yes, again) and I
created [Clermont'ech](https://clermontech.org/), a non-for-profit organization
dedicated to gathering developers in our city. Our goal was simple yet
impactful—organize conferences every two months, known as the [API
Hours](https://clermontech.org/api-hours/).

Reflecting on the past, attending conferences such as Symfony Live 2011 and the
[ParisJS](https://parisjs.org/) events when I was living in Paris was an
eye-opener. When I returned to Clermont-Fd, I talked to some of my friends about
the idea of organizing conferences [here, between the
volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif_Central). Unfortunately, we were
all quite busy, and nothing happened. This was in 2011.

My journey took a significant turn when I moved to Switzerland. There, I
discovered the power of simplicity and freedom: _Wanna do something? Well, just
do it!_ In other words, if you never try you will never know. Back to
Clermont-Fd again, I connected with Julien Maupetit who wanted to build a Python
community:

Yeah, there isn't a lot of Pythonistas in our area. However, there are PHP,
Java, .NET, ..., and JavaScript folks. Hence the idea of not being focused on a
single technology or programming language, but rather, targeting developers at
large. That is how [Clermont'ech](https://clermontech.org) is born, exactly a
year ago.

Julien was really a catalyst, and it was also the right moment, I guess. We
discussed the idea with the LavaJUG folks (Java User Group), the first local
tech organization, which provided invaluable guidance.

The first thing we did was to all agree on a **manifesto** with **four strong
values**:

- **Openness**: we are technology-agnostic, everyone can join the flock;
- **Independence**: we are not tied to any company or organization, no matter
  how much they could give us;
- **Respect**:  people who stir up trouble are not welcomed;
- **Sharing**: every decision we make is driven by this value, we don't _just_
  promote sharing through the conferences.

A year later, I think that this was our main key success factor. We always stick
to this manifesto, we had a clear vision since the beginning, and we all shared
the same point of view.

Then, we tried to create our own identity, and we choose the platypus as our
mascot. _Why?_ Because, platypus are cool, and will always be cool. End of the
story. A special thanks goes to Sophie, our outstanding web designer, by the
way.

The first event was awesome, even though we had no money, no experience in
organizing an event–only a MacBook Pro and a camera. We got more attendees than
expected. Unbelievable. The next API Hours went well, and we reached our limit
of 50 attendees after the second event. The idea behind **limiting the number of
attendees** was pretty straightforward: **we wanted people to meet other
people**, and make the events more **friendly**.

We were more and more prepared, with more equipment, and a lot of **goodies**!
That is probably the second key success factor: **focusing on the marketing
stuff**. This led us to the notion of sponsorship, i.e. **money**. Since the
beginning, we wanted our events to be _free of charge_ for the attendees, but
also, providing food (we are French after all). Thanks to our fabulous sponsors,
we were able to do more, making
[t-shirts](https://www.flickr.com/photos/96523012@N07/10455746815/in/set-72157636366078485),
[stickers](https://www.flickr.com/photos/96523012@N07/10696881453/in/set-72157637356442883),
[business
cards](https://www.flickr.com/photos/96523012@N07/10696880443/in/set-72157637356442883),
postcards, but also **chocolates**!

We held the events in different places, and not always the same day of week so
that new people could show up. We took care of a lot of similar aspects (e.g.,
food for vegans and non-pork eaters, live streaming for those who didn't get a
ticket, and many more you can't probably think of).

But, conferences without speakers are nothing. We wanted the API Hours to be
**community-driven** and that is why we decided to find
[speakers](https://clermontech.org/talks/) locally. Most of our speakers never
spoke at any conference before, but they were all good!

Thanks to these events, I met a lot of interesting people, and not only
developers. I also heard about topics I would not have explored myself. We've
built a vibrant community of approximately 130 individuals (based on our
mailing-list), all involved in computing. I think we are quite well-known now,
since local universities asked us to come and speak to their students. 2014
promises exciting developments as we continue to expand and refine our
initiatives.

If your city lacks a tech organization, consider creating one. It’s an endeavor
worth undertake—it could become a fantastic adventure!
