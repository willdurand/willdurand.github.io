I wrote a [Twitter thread about hardware hacking][^twitter-thread] some time ago.
The idea was to explain _one_ way to obtain privileged access on a device. In
this case, the target was a cheap Chromecast-like device (more on that below)
and I "easily" got `root` access _via_ UART.

This article explains how I reconstructed a modified firmware for this device.

## Overview of the Chrome/Mira/Any-cast device

The target was a cheap Chromecast (or Miracast or Anycast) "clone" bought on
Aliexpress (I am not sure because it was a "gift"). Such a device lets users
cast audio and video on their TV as shown in Figure 1 (HDMI output). In addition
to a HDMI connector, this device is bundled with an external WiFi adapter (USB).

{:.with-caption}

When the device is powered on for the first time, it creates a WiFi network,
e.g., `DONGLE-11BA8F`. Users should first connect to this network with their
smartphone or laptop, and configure the device using a web app as shown in
Figure 2. This step is necessary to allow the device to connect to the user's
WiFi network.

Once the device has restarted and joined the user's WiFi network, users can
theoretically send audio or video to the device and have it played on TV.
According to the manual, this device should work with the "Chromecast protocol"
but it didn't work _that_ well for me.

I was able to cast audio and pictures but not video. Google Home wasn't able to
communicate with the device in a stable manner. I tried many different
applications on both iOS and Android and I wasn't able to achieve much. I tried
to upgrade the device but the remote server was not found... These are the
reasons why I decided to "hack" this device.

Besides having fun, my goal was to find ways to "fix" this device either by
updating the software or re-purposing it. I knew it'd be complex but also that
I'd learn a lot. At the time of writing, I didn't achieve my goal yet but I made
good progress.

I explained how I gained access to a Linux console in the Twitter thread so I am
not going to repeat myself here. Instead, the rest of this blog post describes
what happened next.

## Diving into the content of the SPI flash

I was left with a full dump of the SPI flash (the storage component of this
device) and many questions. I used [binwalk][] to get an overview of the content
of the SPI flash.

The dump contained a Linux kernel (the three first entries in the output below)
and two file systems: [Journalling Flash File System version 2][jffs2] (JFFS2)
and [SquashFS][].

```
$ binwalk flash.dump
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

```

I kindly asked `binwalk` to extract the SquashFS partition:

```
$ ls squashfs-root/
bin/  build.prop*  etc/  fonts/  lib/  usr/  vendor/
```

In the Twitter thread, I mentioned that the device was running Android. This
SquashFS partition is very likely the `system` partition. Among other things, it
contains the content of the web application described in the previous section.
Each page is a [CGI][] ELF binary:

```
$ file squashfs-root/bin/home.cgi
squashfs-root/bin/home.cgi: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /system/bin/linker, stripped
```

After a few Google/GitHub searches, I had found extremely [similar sources of
these CGI files][cgi-sources]. None of these scripts seemed particularly
interesting, though.

I also took a quick look at the JFFS2 partition, which appeared to be the `data`
partition (of an Android-based system) but I didn't find anything useful either.

Last, I used [fdtdump][] to explore the [device tree][], i.e. the "hardware
configuration" of this device for the Linux kernel ([Android uses the Linux
kernel][android-vs-linux]). This gives an idea of which hardware may be present
and how it should be used by the kernel, and it could be useful information
later.

After that, I looked at the _structure_ of the SPI flash.

### MTD partitions

Based on the kernel logs I had captured when I was using the Linux console over
serial, I knew the content was divided into 5 different partitions: _loader_,
_kernel_, _data_, _system_ and _misc_.

```
[    0.379500] Creating 5 MTD partitions on "rk29xxnand":
[    0.379538] 0x000000000000-0x000000040000 : "loader"
[    0.380859] 0x000000040000-0x000000440000 : "kernel"
[    0.382175] 0x000000440000-0x000000500000 : "data"
[    0.383466] 0x000000500000-0x000000ffd000 : "system"
[    0.384697] 0x000000ffd000-0x000000ffe000 : "misc"
```

Out of 5 [MTD partitions][], 3 have been seen previously: `kernel`, `data` and
`system`. Note that the `kernel` partition starts at `0x40000` but `binwalk`
found the `zImage` at `0x40800`. We'll get back to that in a moment. For `data`
and `system`, the offsets in the `binwalk` output match the base addresses in
the logs above.

This time, I used `dd` to split the original dump into different binary files
based on the address ranges printed in the kernel logs above. I then looked at
each file individually, and made the following observations:

1. `kernel.bin` is not recognized by `file`, weird.
2. although `data.bin` and `system.bin` are correctly detected as file systems
   by `file`, the `.bin` files extracted with `dd` seem different than the files
   extracted with `binwalk`. Maybe because `binwalk` tried to find [magic
   numbers][] and metadata (like the size of the content it has to extract)? I
   am not sure.
3. `misc.bin` is an "empty" binary file.

```
$ file *.bin
loader.bin:  data
kernel.bin:  data
data.bin  :  Linux jffs2 filesystem data little endian
system.bin:  Squashfs filesystem, little endian, version 4.0, xz compressed, 10778932 bytes, 412 inodes, blocksize :  524288 bytes, created :  Wed Dec  2 03:03:01 2020
misc.bin  :  ISO-8859 text, with very long lines, with no line terminators
```

Given I had already analyzed the "data partitions" (`data` and `system`), I
decided to study the `loader` and `kernel` partitions next.

### The loader partition

I ran `strings` on the `loader.bin` file, which returned a few strings that I
already read before. Indeed, this partition contains the code that loads the
Linux kernel and some of the strings found in the binary appeared in the boot
logs collected over serial:

```

```

It looks like the bootloader is named "DDR" and the version is `1.08`. I found
binaries for [other versions of this bootloader][rkbin] on the web but not for
the version I had (huh?), and no source code.

I also ran `hexdump` on `loader.bin` and was faced with the following output:

```

```

I tried to find more information about the `RKFP` magic number. There isn't a
lot of information about it. This seems to be a proprietary image format but its
structure is partially known and open source. I found the definitions of the
different structures in [`rkflash_blk.h`][rkflash_blk.h] (Linux kernel) and
[this page][rk1108-linux310] helped a lot by providing additional context!

### The kernel partition

I read the `kernel.bin` file with `hexdump`. The first few bytes are shown
below:

```
$ hexdump -C part-kernel.bin
00000000  4b 45 52 4e 45 4c 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |KERNEL..........|

00000030  79 9c d3 78 d9 3f d6 5a  c7 34 03 ec 1b 09 84 b9  |y..x.?.Z.4......|
00000040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
...
```

This looks like some kind of partition header. That's odd because (1) the other
partitions don't appear to have any header like that, and (2) I only found
RockChip tools that deal with images with `KRNL` as magic number, not `KERNEL`.
Ugh.

In the `hexdump` output above, I noticed two values on the second line that
looked familiar. Indeed, in the bootloader logs, there were these two lines:

```
hdr.loader_load_size= 2efa00
hdr.loader_load_addr= 62000000
```

The load address is therefore at offset `0x10` in this "kernel header", and the
(kernel?) size is at offset `0x15`. Then we have another 4 bytes, which seems to
be the CRC for this header. The next 4 bytes hold a value of `0x20` and that
looks like the length of the following bytes (from `0x20` to `0x40`). Some
checksum, maybe? This could be the length of a SHA-256 hash.

After this header, there is some padding until offset `0x800` where we find some
ARM instructions (`00 00 A0 E1`). This explains why `binwalk` found the kernel
at `0x40800` before.

At this point, I had enough information about the content of the SPI flash. As
stated at the top of this blog post, my goal was to fix this device. Writing a
parser for these RKFP images would be a good first step to be able to update the
firmware eventually.

## Parsing RKFP images

I developed [a tool][github-repo] in C to print information about RKFP images. I
also found two other similar (SPI flash) dumps in the wild, allowing me to have
more examples while developing my tool. In particular, it turned out that the
image I had dumped myself had a CRC mismatch 😅

```

Most partitions were not new because they were listed as "MTD partitions" and I
had already analyzed some of them. The tool found 6 _RKFP partitions_, though.
Instead of having a `loader` partition, we had two partitions: `vendor` and
`IDBlock`. "ID Block" is apparently a header for Rockchip BootRom.

Next, I wrote a new command (`extract_rkfp`) to extract the actual data located
in each RKFP partition. It is worth mentioning that I later found the
[rkflashtool][] project, which offers a tool to unpack RKFP images too (among
other things). Both this tool and mine were producing identical partition
files.

At this point, I was able to read information from a RKFP image, verify the
different CRCs and extract the data contained in each partition. I had two
options: (1) stop there and forget about this project, or (2) find out how to
make a RKFP image 😬

## Reconstructing RKFP images

I tried to reconstruct the RKFP images I had (the one I dumped and two I found
online). My idea was to invert the "read" process by appending the different
RKFP partitions extracted with `make_rkfp` after having written a "RKFP header".

Obviously, this didn't work... I used [VBinDiff][] (a lot) to compare the
original image and the one I had reconstructed with my tool. The header appeared
to be correct but there were differences in the `IDBlock` partition and in some
other locations.

I realized that the `IDBlock` partition was special: although it had a data size
of `N`, its actual size was almost three times bigger and after having inspected
its content, I had the impression that there was more data than what the
partition metadata was saying. Some more searches about this mysterious
`setting.ini` file mentioned [here][rk1108-linux310] made me conclude that there
were probably two loaders. Given that this partition likely contained
proprietary code that I needed anyway but didn't necessarily need to change, I
adjusted my tool. I special-case'd the `IDBlock` partition so that the entire
partition was (1) extracted with `extract_rkfp`, and (2) written with
`make_rkfp`.

I could then generate a RKFP image that looked almost like the original one. The
images I found online had extra "backup metadata", which I didn't have in the
image coming from my device. I wrote code for that, too.

I was kinda confident with my tool but I hadn't tried the new images on the
device yet so its effectiveness was purely theoretical.

## A breakout board for SOIC-16

In order to verify that my tool was producing correct firmware, I needed a way
to write to the SPI flash chip and then boot the device. Near the end of the
Twitter thread, the flash had been desoldered. Soldering and desoldering the
flash every time was not an option, and I couldn't properly use [flashrom][]
when the flash was soldered on the device.

I decided to design a small PCB to get access to the flash pins using a 1.27mm
16-pin socket, which would be soldered on the device (see Figure 3). The same
board could also be reused with a plug on one side and the flash chip on the
other side (see Figure 4).

![](/images/posts/2022/03/kicad-breakout-board.webp)
_Figure 3: The 3D view of the breakout board for SOIC-16_
{:.with-caption}

It was the first time I designed a PCB with castellated holes. [OSH Park][] did
an amazing work on such small boards (about the size of 1 cent coins) 😍

![](/images/posts/2022/03/socket-and-plug.wepb)
_Figure 4: A breakout board is mounted on the PCB and a<br>second breakout board
holds the SPI flash + a plug on the other side_
{:.with-caption}

With these breakout boards assembled (see Figure 5), I could easily write to the
flash and test my changes on real hardware. Before that, I made sure that the
device could still boot with the original firmware (still present on the flash).

![](/images/posts/2022/03/breakout-board-on-pcb.webp)
_Figure 5: The SPI flash mounted on the device (blue circle)_
{:.with-caption}

I then used [flashrom][] to put the reconstructed (unmodified) firmware on the
SPI flash and I powered on the device. Success! The device booted and everything
seemed to work as before.

My next experiment was about producing and booting a modified firmware.

## Modifying the system partition

I opted to change the system partition. The first step was to know which options
to use to rebuild the SquashFS partition:

```
$ unsquashfs -s part-system.bin
Found a valid SQUASHFS 4:0 superblock on 500000.squashfs.
Creation or last append time Wed Dec  2 04:03:01 2020
Filesystem size 10778932 bytes (10526.30 Kbytes / 10.28 Mbytes)
Compression xz
        Dictionary size 524288
        Filters selected: arm
Block size 524288
...
```

I changed a file in the extracted content and then rebuilt the partition:

```
$ mksquashfs squashfs-root new-system-partition.bin -comp xz -Xbcj arm -b 524288 -all-root
```

I then reused the `make_rkfp` command to create a new RKFP image and loaded it
on the SPI flash, then put the flash back on the device and powered it on. 3..
2.. 1.. Success! 😎

_Figure 6: HDMI output with the modified firmware_
{:.with-caption}

## Work in progress

Only the `system` partition has been altered in the previous section but the
`data` partition could have been equally modified. I had no interest in changing
the `loader` partition and the `misc` one was empty. This leaves us with the
`kernel` partition.

I added a `extract_kernel` command to my tool to extract the data from the
`kernel` partition. This was a requirement to understand how to make such a
`kernel` partition in the future, the main motivation being to eventually update
the version of the Linux kernel.

The extracted data appears to be a `zImage` with DTB files appended to it. I am
not too sure how that has been generated yet, maybe just `cat zImage *.dtb > kernel`?
A [initial ramdisk][] seems to be part of that same `zImage` too, and it
contains different `init.*.rc` files.

The next steps will be to build a new Linux kernel that looks like the extracted
one, and see if that works.

## Conclusion

After having gained root access on this device, I have been able to modify the
original firmware. Out of 5 MTD partitions, all but two have been fully analyzed
(`loader` and `kernel`). I designed a breakout board to easily verify firmware
produced with a tool I created specifically for this project. This was also a
good excuse to learn about [modern CMake][modern-cmake] 😉

As mentioned before in this article, I was not too interested in the `loader`
partition, hence my focus on the `kernel` partition near the end. In the future,
I want to build a new kernel image and load it on the device. There are two
known issues so far: (1) building the right (Android) kernel for the device, and
(2) creating a kernel partition for the RKFP image. We'll see how it goes...

Last but not least, both the tool and the KiCad files have been [published on
GitHub][github-repo]. Enjoy!

[^twitter-thread]: This used to be a link to a Twitter thread from me. I
    documented how I gained (root) access on a cheap device, which involved
    hardware and software skills.
