This is one of those moments worth calling out explicitly.

> Yes, it happened on Slack

Here, _it_ refers to a decision, an agreement, or some important results. All of
these should NOT have been left on Slack alone. At the very least, the Slack
threads or some key messages should have been copied into some more open and
permanent places like Bugzilla or GitHub (in public issues).

It won't come as a surprise; I don't like Slack (but it wasn't always like
that). There is a reason for that: it is **the antithesis of working in the
open**. What happens in Slack stays in Slack. What stays in Slack is basically
lost forever. "Chat apps" aren't the right tools for decision-making, especially
when working with external contributors and distributed teams across the globe.

I understand the need for synchronous communication, but (1) we have Matrix at
Mozilla, which is open at least, and (2) we should not use Slack for
asynchronous communication. Let's just use it for quick feedback, instant chats
about sensitive topics, GIFs, and emojis on every other message. Jokes aside,
it's easier to restrict some content than to publish private content more
broadly.

[Working in the open][working-open] is what makes Firefox and other Mozilla
products so special: anyone can contribute. Each individual can find information
about a decision on GitHub or Bugzilla. I personally dig into old GitHub issues
at least once a week, usually with a question in mind like "why did we do
that?". Back then, everything was either relatively well documented on
GitHub/Bugzilla or captured in broadly accessible Google Docs, which makes it
possible to answer my question. Nowadays, it's not uncommon for me to "request
access" to some docs I have to read for my own work...

We should continue to use open and accessible platforms to capture not only the
decisions but also the "why" (context), and keep them available for the future.
Not only will this be useful to us, but it will also allow our contributors to
participate even more and feel more "in the loop".

_Note: this article reflects my experience within my team at Mozilla, but the
views expressed may be relevant beyond that context._
