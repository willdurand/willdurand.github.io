There we are.

> Yes, it happened on Slack

Here, _"it"_ refers to a decision, an agreement or some important results.  All
of these should NOT have been left in Slack alone. At the very least, the Slack
threads or some key messages should have been copied to some more open and
permanent places like Bugzilla or GitHub (in public issues).

It won't come as a surprise, [I don't like Slack][hate-slack] (but [it wasn't
always like that][remote-work]). There is a reason to that: it is **the
antithesis of working in the open**. What happens in Slack stays in Slack. What
stays in Slack is basically lost forever. "Chat apps" aren't the right tool for
decision-making, especially when working with external contributors and
distributed teams across the globe.

I understand the need for synchronous communication but (1) we have Matrix at
Mozilla, which is open at least, and (2) we should not use Slack for
asynchronous communication. Let's just use it for quick feedback, instant chats
about sensitive topics, GIFs, and emoji on every other message. Joke aside, it's
easier to restrict some content than publishing private content more broadly.

[Working in the open][working-open] is what makes Firefox and other Mozilla
products so special: anyone can contribute. Each individual can find information
about a decision in GitHub or Bugzilla. I personally dig into old GitHub issues
at least once a week, usually with a question in mind like "why did we do
that?". Back then, everything was either relatively well documented in
GitHub/Bugzilla or captured in broadly accessible Google docs, which makes it
possible to answer my question. Nowadays, it's not uncommon for me to "request
access" to some docs I have to read for my own work...

We should continue to use open and accessible platforms to capture not only the
decisions but also the "why" (context), and keep them available for the future.
Not only will this be useful to us but it will also allow our contributors to
participate even more and feel more "in the loop".

Important note: I wrote this article in the context of my very own team at
Mozilla. Those are my views and they could be applied to other companies as
well.
