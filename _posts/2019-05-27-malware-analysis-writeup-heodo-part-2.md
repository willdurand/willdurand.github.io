This is Part 2 of a malware analysis I did last week. This time, it was not an
exercise!

In [Part 1]({% post_url 2019-05-24-malware-analysis-writeup-heodo-part-1 %}), I
described how I extracted a PowerShell script executed by a VBA macro hidden in
a Word document. At the end, I was able to download the program that was
supposed to be downloaded by the PowerShell script. In the sequel, I am going to
describe the analysis of this program named `71.exe`.

## First look

I uploaded the program to VirusTotal again and found out that it was already
known. Looking at the report, it did not look like the executable was packed,
but entropy was still quite high. This happens when a program embeds some
content, like other DLLs, executables, etc.

The first thing that struck me was the use of the following functions:

```
CADeleteCA
CAEnumFirstCA
CAEnumNextCA
CACloseCA
CACloseCertType
```

I thought that this malware was maybe installing/replacing a rogue certificate
somehow. From VirusTotal, that's all I could gather so I decided to boot a
Windows 7 VM and started a static analysis.

## Static analysis

I started by running [`strings`](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_(Unix)>)
on the `71.exe` file. I found some function names and a lot of garbage but
nothing really obvious. Using `PeID`, I could not find evidences of a
[packer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_compression), same with
[DIE](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy).

I used `PeView` to look more into the different
[sections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/debug/pe-format#general-concepts)
and did not spot any big problem (again, based on my knowledge). Virtual and raw
sizes looked similar and section names were not weird. I concluded that the
program was likely decoding its instructions at runtime.

|       | virtual size    | size of raw data |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| .text | 4280 (0x10b8)   | 4608 (0x1200)    |
| .data | 70580 (0x113b4) | 70656 (0x11400)  |

> _Post-mortem:_ I might have missed something though, but at the time, that's
> all I could gather.

Given that I was stuck and could not find more useful information about this
executable, I decided to switch to dynamic analysis 👻

## Dynamic analysis

> Dynamic analysis is any examination performed after executing malware.
> <br>_– In Practical Malware Analysis, Chapter 3_

In a Windows 7 32-bit VM, I started a few tools and then executed the malicious
program in order to analyze its behavior 💣 After a few seconds, the program
disappeared as shown in Figure 1. I already saw this behavior during a previous
analysis, so I made a copy of the program before running it.

executed](/images/posts/2019/05/run-and-disappear.gif)

### Procmon

Further investigation using
[`Procmon`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon)
revealed that it renamed itself to `C:\Windows\System32\hotspotsel.exe` (_cf._
Figure 2). Given that this path was not present in the `strings` output, I had
the confirmation that the program was decrypting its instructions at runtime and
only loaded information in memory when needed. This seems to be a common
protection against malware analysts. That was quite unexpected given that its
Downloader (_cf._ [Part 1]({% post_url
2019-05-24-malware-analysis-writeup-heodo-part-1 %})) was pretty easy to
reverse.

### Regshot

I continued my analysis by reviewing the diff of the Windows registry created
with [`Regshot`](https://sourceforge.net/p/regshot/wiki/Home/) as depicted in
Figure 3 (Right-click > "View image" to display the image in full size).

opened](/images/posts/2019/05/regshot-diff.png)
_Figure 3: A `diff` of the registry created with Regshot_
{:.with-caption}

I discovered two interesting facts about the program:

1. it creates a service called `hotspotsel.exe` that is supposed to "copy user
   certificates and root certificates from smart cards [...]". The service is
   persistent and survives reboots based on the `sc query` output shown in
   Figure 4.

   ![A screenshot of the output of sc query](/images/posts/2019/05/sc-qc.png)
   _Figure 4: The output of service control_
   {:.with-caption}

2. it turns on a feature called
   [WPAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Proxy_Auto-Discovery_Protocol).
   Googling this term revealed that this Windows feature was a known
   vulnerability.

With the second fact combined to the references to the `CA*` functions, I really
thought that this program was trying to get access to secure exchanges (HTTPS)
but I was only guessing.

### Process Explorer

Looking at [`Process Explorer`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer),
I could confirm that the service was running and I discovered that it was
started with a command line argument. I supposed that the presence of the
argument started the program in a "service" mode instead of trying to install
itself as a service (like when I executed the program manually).

The printable strings retrieved from the running service memory were not super
helpful unfortunately. I could find the service name (`hostspotsel`) as well as
the fully qualified path to the executable and the name of the computer followed
by 6 characters, but nothing else.

Last thing I discovered was a bunch of network calls with what seemed random IP
addresses and different ports such as: 80, 8080, 443, 465, 22, etc. The Windows
VM was fully isolated during this analysis phase, so all requests failed and I
could not gather new information. It was time to perform a network analysis.

## Network analysis

Network analysis is still dynamic analysis but focused on network activities.

In order to do that, I recreated a new lab containing a Windows 7 VM as well as
a [REMnux](https://remnux.org/) (Linux) VM, both in the same VirtualBox
"internal network". I configured the Linux VM so that it catches all TCP/IP
packets, no matter the destination IPs. In the Windows VM, I set the gateway IP
to the Linux IP. I had noted some destination ports before so I started a bunch
of `netcat` on different ports in the Linux VM as well.

I executed the `71.exe` program in the Windows 7 VM again. In `Process Explorer`, I saw that some network calls were `ESTABLISHED`, which meant that
the malware was able to connect to its servers. That's what the malware thought
though, because it actually connected to the Linux VM, which received a bunch of
HTTP `POST` requests in the different `netcat` I had started before. There is an
example in Figure 5.

![A screenshot of a Linux terminal with a POST request captured by
netcat](/images/posts/2019/05/remnux-nc.png)
_Figure 5: A `POST` HTTP request captured by `netcat` listening on port `8080`_
{:.with-caption}

For each request, the HTTP body was
[base64-URL-encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5). I tried to
decode some of these bodies but none was readable. The content was probably
encrypted first and then encoded with base64.

## Hello, Heodo

I noted the IP addresses and ports printed in the different `netcat` outputs,
and I used Google again to get more information. I found that one IP address was
referenced as a [C2
server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet#Command_and_control) of a famous
botnet called... **Heodo**. I put a name on this malware, finally!

I then gathered more information about Heodo:

1. it is a variant of
   [Emotet](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.emotet). I did
   not expect to analyse one of the most prevalent malware as a first!
2. This malware is often distributed _via_ emails using an attachment (like a
   Word document) that contains a malicious PowerShell script to download and
   install it.
3. Once the malware is installed, it tries to reach a C2 server from a list.
   That's exactly what I noticed during my network analysis, cool.
4. Exchanges are encrypted with RSA. That is probably why I could not read
   anything after having decoded the base64-URL-encoded HTTP bodies.
5. When the malware tries to [phone
   home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoning_home) for the first time, it
   collects and sends data to the C2 server, which might respond differently
   depending on what is sent. For example, it sends the computer name followed
   by some information about the CPU and the list of running processes. If this
   list contains a malware analysis tool, it will not send a new program but
   either nothing or itself.

Even though most of my findings matched the characteristics of Heodo/Emotet, I
was not 100% sure that the program I was analyzing was Heodo/Emotet. C2 servers
might be compromised by more than one bad actor, so we cannot only infer the
malware based on the IPs it interacts with (I think).

## Debugger

I decided to attach the `Ollydbg` debugger to the running service
(`hotspotsel.exe`) to see if I could learn something new. I only used this
debugger twice before and during guided exercises so I did not really know what
I was doing -\_\_-

I decided to pause the execution when a connection was established
(this can be seen in `Process Explorer`). I tried to find ASCII strings and
eventually found an IP address. This IP address also appeared in one of the
`netcat` outputs on the Linux VM. I told the debugger to find the IP address in
the memory dump and manually reviewed what was there before and after this
point. I found a long list of process names, including `OLLYDBG.EXE` and
`VBoxTray.exe` as depicted in Figure 6. This is the list of all the running
processes in the Windows VM!

![A screenshot of the Ollydbg debugger](/images/posts/2019/05/ollydbg.png)
_Figure 6: The `Ollydbg` window with a list of processes (in the blue
rectangle)_
{:.with-caption}

I was also able to find a few more IP addresses in the memory dump and the
computer name again, followed by the same characters I read in `Process Explorer` before (in the "printable strings").

These findings validated the 5th item in the previous section: Heodo/Emotet
malware send the list of running processes to their C2 servers. That way, C2
servers can detect malware analysts. The program will likely keep sending this
list until the C2 server tells it to do something else.

At this point, I was confident and decided to stop my analysis here. I reached
my goal: I discovered which malware was installed by the Word document received
by my friend.

## What's next?

I found a great [deep analysis of an Emotet
variant](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/deep-analysis-of-new-emotet-variant-part-1.html)
as well as some [interesting tools](https://github.com/tadavies/emotet) when I
was writing this article. It seems possible to patch the malware at runtime to
hopefully retrieve other malicious programs. This requires to connect the
Windows VM to the Internet, though. In the future, I'd like to perform a similar
analysis.

I would also like to see if I can fully reverse the `71.exe` program to retrieve
the RSA keys, C2 IP addresses and so on (if possible). Reverse engineering is
not my best strength though.

## Recap'

- I analyzed a malware with various techniques.
- I discovered that this malware was a well-known malware named Heodo.
