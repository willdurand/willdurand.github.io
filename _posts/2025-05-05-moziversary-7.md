_A few days ago, this was my seventh Moziversary üéÇ I joined Mozilla as a
full-time employee on May 1st, 2018. I previously blogged in ~~2019~~, [2020][],
[2021][], [2022][], [2023][], and [2024][]._

While I may not have the energy to reflect extensively on the past year right
now, I can say with confidence that the last 12 months have been incredibly
productive, and things are generally going well for me.

Seven years later, I am still part of the Add-ons team. As a [senior staff][]
engineer, I am no longer working full time on [the WebExtensions
team][new-team-mozilla].  Instead, I am spending my time on anything related to
Add-ons within Mozilla (be it Firefox, AMO, etc.).

My team went through a lot of changes over the last few years[^1], with some
years more memorable than others. About a year ago, things started to head into
the right direction, and I am rather hopeful. It's going to take some time, but
the team is really set up for success again!

Shout-out to all my amazing colleagues at Mozilla, I wouldn't be where I am
today without y'all ‚ù§Ô∏è

[^1]: Let's talk briefly about the elephant. Mozilla has changed a lot too but I
    don't have much control over that so I tend to not think too much about it ü§∑
