Hi folks!

Few months ago, I decided to lock [my plain old blog](http://www.willdurand.fr) in French.
To own a blog is really important but I was bored to write in French, and I had no free time to
answer comments, to write new entries, and so on.

That's why I'm starting this new blog, in English (as well-written as possible) powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll),
[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), and hosted by [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

You'll get the code by browsing the following repository: [willdurand/willdurand.github.com](https://github.com/willdurand/willdurand.github.com).

William
