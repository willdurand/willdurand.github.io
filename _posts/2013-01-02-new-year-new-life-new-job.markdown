Today was my first day at [Michelin](http://www.michelin.com/corporate/EN/home),
and that's a significant turning point in my life.

I started a **PhD in software testing** and verification. I'm doing research
on **optimizing and reusing tests** for applications and production machines in
a [model-based testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_testing)
approach. That's a terrific challenge!

I will also be teaching PHP and Symfony2 at [IUT de
Clermont-Fd](http://www.iut.u-clermont1.fr/). And because I will be quite busy
this year, I decided to close down my own company, and to dedicate my free
time in Open Source.

Last but not the least, I wish you a **Happy New Year** and **all the best**
for 2013!
