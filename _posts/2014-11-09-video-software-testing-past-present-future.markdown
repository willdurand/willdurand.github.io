Last month, I gave a talk on software testing at [Forum PHP
2014](http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2014/) in Paris, organized by the french
foundation of French speaking PHP users
([AFUP](http://www.afup.org/pages/site/)). Then again, congratulations to the
team, this event was a blast! (As usual, I would say :-))

In this talk, I gave an overview of what software testing was, describing three
different periods: past, present, and future, hence the title of this talk.

You will find the video of my talk (in French, sorry) below:
