_Three years at Mozilla, yay! üéâ It's my longest time at the same company, and I
am now a [Staff Software Engineer][promotion]. What a ride!_

A year ago, [I wrote that I was starting to be more involved in
Firefox][moziversary-2]. I worked on very diverse projects in 2020 but one of
them was super fun: we revamped the AMO statistics and it required backend
changes on AMO, some ETL/BigQuery work, and new data collection in Firefox. I
worked on all those components and learned a lot of stuff along the way. I also
[deleted a lot of code][^deleted-code], [changed a lot of code][^black],
contributed to Firefox for Android (Fenix), created new libraries to support the
work of my team, continued to work on security stuff, and even wrote some PHP
lately.

My role is constantly evolving. By knowing every bit of the AMO platform and
expanding my skill sets with contributions in Firefox, I am hoping to have a
wider vision of add-ons in general, from a technical perspective. I am doing my
best to bridge the gap between the AMO and WebExtensions engineering teams,
which will be welcomed as more Product requirements need changes in both
contexts.

Now, thinking about the last 12 months, there are areas that I would like to
improve.

I mentioned it above, I work on very different projects and components.  It's
exciting because I am never bored, I can help many folks and I learn a lot but
context switching is hard. My tmux session has ~10 windows open all the time
nowadays (one per project) so I had to adapt. I wrote a bunch of scripts to
automate some maintenance tasks, I started to dedicate specific days to certain
projects, and I learned to be more strict about priorities. I still have some
work to do on that front, though.

I noticed that all these different projects kinda "forced" me to "move fast",
and too fast actually. It didn't negatively impact anything (yet) but I've
definitely been reminded that the answer to my question was in the GitHub issue
that I had just read. Hence I am working on taking more time to think... and
I'll also take the opportunity to refine my communication skills.

Last, I am extremely happy at Mozilla and I am super lucky to be part of the
amazing Add-ons team. I would like to thank everyone in my team as well as all
the folks I worked with so far! I wouldn't be where I am today without you ‚ù§Ô∏è

    diff stats, showing a lot of changed code after having applied a python code
    formatter on a large codebase.

[^deleted-code]: This used to be a link to a tweet from me. I tweeted a
    screenshot with diff stats, showing a lot of code removed after I removed a
    lot of code in a project.
