_(A quick update on my personal life.)_

[Three years ago]({% post_url 2013-01-02-new-year-new-life-new-job %}), I
started a PhD. I am happy to let the Internets™ know that I successfully
defended it two weeks ago! I can now officially call myself a doctor (lol).

For what it is worth, you can find my slides below, but I think you will be more
interested in the thesis itself: [Automated Test Generation for production
systems with a Model-based Testing approach](/papers/phd-thesis-v2.pdf).

PS: I did not choose the date of my defense myself ;-)
