I remember a conversation I had with a colleague a while back, shortly after I
joined, where they told me that promotions at Mozilla were almost
inevitable‚Äîthat if you just stuck around long enough, you'd get promoted
eventually[^1].

It certainly didn't feel like that to me.

I've been working at Mozilla for about 7 years and I was last [promoted in
2021]({% post_url 2021-02-26-i-got-a-promotion %}). I joined the [WebExtensions
team in 2022]({% post_url 2022-01-25-new-team-mozilla %}) to work on Manifest
Version 3, and then I led the engineering efforts to offer full add-ons support
for Firefox for Android in 2023. I became the tech lead for Add-ons in 2024.

This month, I've been promoted to **Senior Staff Software Engineer**! ü•≥

_But, what is a Senior Staff?_ Mozilla says it is an individual "recognized as
one of a small set of renowned experts in an important area", who is able to
"lead projects requiring implementation across multiple teams".

I'm grateful to my manager and coworkers for their support and guidance over the
years. I've been able to achieve so much more than I thought possible thanks to
them! ‚ù§Ô∏è

[^1]: Coincidentally, and years later, another colleague told me this person had
    actually worked hard to get where they were, and it wasn't just a matter of
    showing up and waiting for a promotion to happen üôÉ
