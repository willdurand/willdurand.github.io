The year is 2022 and I am still using my blog to share personal-ish status updates. Yeah, I am _that_ old. Today's post is about my career.

I work at Mozilla for ~4 years now (including my time as a contractor). After having worked on [many](/2020/05/01/moziversary-2/) [things](/2021/05/01/moziversary-3/) and getting a [promotion](/2021/02/26/i-got-a-promotion/) not too long ago, I made a [lateral move](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/lateral-career-moves/).

I am now a full time **Firefox engineer**, working on the [WebExtensions API](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/about-the-webextensions-api/). I've been working on "web apps" for most of my career and now I'll be writing code for developers to write browser extensions.

This is scary and maybe a bit silly (career-wise) but this is also an incredible challenge for me. That's what I wanted. That's what I needed. I left a great team to join a fantastic team where I'll be the least experienced in the domain we own. It _almost_ feels like I am back at the beginning of my career, except that I now know how much I don't know. Ha, well. It's going to be fine.
