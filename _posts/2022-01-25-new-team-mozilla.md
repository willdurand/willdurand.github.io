The year is 2022 and I am still using my blog to share personal-ish status
updates. Yeah, I am _that_ old. Today's post is about my career.

I work at Mozilla for ~4 years now (including my time as a contractor). After
having worked on [many](/2020/05/01/moziversary-2/)
[things](/2021/05/01/moziversary-3/) and getting a
[promotion](/2021/02/26/i-got-a-promotion/) not too long ago, I made a [lateral
move](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/lateral-career-moves/).

I am now a full-time **Firefox engineer**, working on the [WebExtensions API][].
I've been working on "web apps" for most of my career and now I'll be writing
code for developers to write browser extensions.

This is scary and maybe a bit silly (career-wise) but this is also an incredible
challenge for me. That's what I wanted. That's what I needed. I left a great
team to join a fantastic team where I am the least experienced in the domain we
own. It _almost_ feels like I am back at the beginning of my career, except that
I now know how much I don't know. Ha, well. It's going to be fine.
