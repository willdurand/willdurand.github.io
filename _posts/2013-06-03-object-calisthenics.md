Last month, I gave a talk about [Object
Calisthenics](http://williamdurand.fr/object-calisthenics-slides/) at
[Clermont'ech](http://clermontech.org)'s
[APIHour #2](http://clermontech.org/api-hours/api-hour-2.html), a local
developer group based in Clermont-Ferrand (France).

I discovered **Object Calisthenics** almost two years ago, but I wasn't
open-minded enough to give them a try. A year ago, [Guilherme
Blanco](https://twitter.com/guilhermeblanco) and I were
[drinking beers](https://twitter.com/jmikola/status/210448122642575360/photo/1)
in Paris. He told me that [Rafael Dohms](https://twitter.com/rdohms) and him
ported the concept of Object Calisthenics to PHP. That was awesome, and I
decided to learn, understand, and try these rules. I am now convinced that
these rules are really helpful, and that trying to respect these rules help you
write **better Oriented Object code**.

> Cal • is • then • ics - /ˌkaləsˈTHeniks/

Object Calisthenics are **programming exercises**, formalized as a set of **9
rules** invented by Jeff Bay in his book [The ThoughtWorks
Anthology](http://pragprog.com/book/twa/thoughtworks-anthology). The word
_Object_ is related to Object Oriented Programming. The word _Calisthenics_
is derived from greek, and means **exercises** under the context of gymnastics.
By trying to follow these rules as much as possible, you will naturally change
how you write code. It doesn't mean you have to follow all these rules, all the
time. Find your balance with these rules, use some of them only if you feel
comfortable with them.

These rules focus on **maintainability**, **readability**, **testability**,
and **comprehensibility** of your code. If you already write code that is
maintainable, readable, testable, and comprehensible, then these rules will
help you write code that is more maintainable, more readable, more testable,
and more comprehensible.

In the following, I will review each of these 9 rules listed below:

1. [Only One Level Of Indentation Per
   Method](#1-only-one-level-of-indentation-per-method)
2. [Don't Use The ELSE Keyword](#2-dont-use-the-else-keyword)
3. [Wrap All Primitives And Strings](#3-wrap-all-primitives-and-strings)
4. [First Class Collections](#4-first-class-collections)
5. [One Dot Per Line](#5-one-dot-per-line)
6. [Don't Abbreviate](#6-dont-abbreviate)
7. [Keep All Entities Small](#7-keep-all-entities-small)
8. [No Classes With More Than Two Instance
   Variables](#8-no-classes-with-more-than-two-instance-variables)
9. [No Getters/Setters/Properties](#9-no-getterssettersproperties)

## 1. Only One Level Of Indentation Per Method

Having **too many levels of indentation** in your code **is often bad for
readability**, and maintainability. Most of the time, you can't easily
understand the code without _compiling_ it in your head, especially if you have
various conditions at different level, or a loop in another loop, as shown in
this example:

```java
class Board {
    public String board() {
        StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();

        // 0
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            // 1
            for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
                // 2
                buf.append(data[i][j]);
            }
            buf.append("\n");
        }

        return buf.toString();
    }
}
```

In order to follow this rule, you have to split your methods up. Martin Fowler,
in his book [Refactoring](http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html),
introduces the [**Extract
Method**](http://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html) pattern, which is
exactly what you have to do/use.

You won't reduce the number of lines of code, but you will **increase
readability** in a significant way:

```java
class Board {
    public String board() {
        StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();

        collectRows(buf);

        return buf.toString();
    }

    private void collectRows(StringBuilder buf) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            collectRow(buf, i);
        }
    }

    private void collectRow(StringBuilder buf, int row) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            buf.append(data[row][i]);
        }

        buf.append("\n");
    }
}
```

## 2. Don't Use The ELSE Keyword

The `else` keyword is well-known as the `if/else` construct is built into nearly
all programming languages. Do you remember the last time you saw a nested
conditional? Did you enjoy reading it? I don't think so, and that is exactly why
it should be avoided. As it is so easy to add a new branch to the existing code
than refactoring it to a better solution, you often end up with a really bad
code.

```java
public void login(String username, String password) {
    if (userRepository.isValid(username, password)) {
        redirect("homepage");
    } else {
        addFlash("error", "Bad credentials");

        redirect("login");
    }
}
```

An easy way to remove the `else` keyword is to rely on the **early return**
solution.

```java
public void login(String username, String password) {
    if (userRepository.isValid(username, password)) {
        return redirect("homepage");
    }

    addFlash("error", "Bad credentials");

    return redirect("login");
}
```

The condition can be either **optimistic**, meaning you have conditions for your
error cases and the rest of your method follows the default scenario,
or you can adopt a **defensive approach** (somehow related to [Defensive
Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming)), meaning you
put the default scenario into a condition, and if it is not satisfied, then you
return an error status. This is better as it prevents potential issues you
didn't think about.

As an alternative, you can **introduce a variable** in order to make your
**return statement parametrizable**. This is not always possible though.

```java
public void login(String username, String password) {
    String redirectRoute = "homepage";

    if (!userRepository.isValid(username, password)) {
        addFlash("error", "Bad credentials");
        redirectRoute = "login";
    }

    redirect(redirectRoute);
}
```

Also, it is worth mentioning that Object Oriented Programming gives us powerful
features, such as **polymorphism**. Last but not least, the **Null Object**,
**State** and **Strategy** patterns may help you as well!

For instance, instead of using `if/else` to determine an action based on a
status (e.g. `RUNNING`, `WAITING`, etc.), prefer the [State
pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) as it is used to
encapsulate varying behavior for the same routine based on an object's state
object:

<small class="source">Source:
[http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/state](http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/state).
</small>

## 3. Wrap All Primitives And Strings

Following this rule is pretty easy, you simply have to **encapsulate all the
primitives within objects**, in order to avoid the [**Primitive
Obsession**](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrimitiveObsession) anti-pattern.

If the variable of your primitive type has a **behavior**, you MUST encapsulate
it. And this is especially true for **Domain Driven Design**. **DDD** describes
**Value Objects** like `Money`, or `Hour` for instance.

## 4. First Class Collections

**Any class that contains a collection should contain no other member
variables**. If you have a set of elements and want to manipulate them, create
a class that is dedicated for this set.

Each collection gets wrapped in its own class, so now **behaviors related to the
collection have a home** (e.g. filter methods, applying a rule to each element).

## 5. One Dot Per Line

This _dot_ is the one you use to call methods in Java, or C# for instance. It
would be an arrow in PHP, but who uses PHP anyway? :D

Basically, the rule says that **you should not chain method calls**. However, it
doesn't apply to [**Fluent
Interfaces**](http://flippinawesome.org/2013/05/20/fluent-apis-and-method-chaining/)
and more generally to anything implementing the [Method Chaining
Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/dslCatalog/methodChaining.html)
(e.g. a Query Builder).

For other classes, you should respect this rule. It is the direct use of the
[Law of Demeter](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LawOfDemeter), saying only **talk to
your immediate friends**, and don't talk to strangers.

Look at these classes:

```java
class Location {
    public Piece current;
}
```

```java
class Piece {
    public String representation;
}
```

```java
class Board {
    public String boardRepresentation() {
        StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();

        for (Location loc : squares()) {
            buf.append(loc.current.representation.substring(0, 1));
        }

        return buf.toString();
    }
}
```

It is ok-ish to have `public` attributes in `Piece` and `Location`. Actually,
having a `public` property or a `private` one with getter/setter is the same
thing (see [Rule 9](#9-no-getters/setters/properties)).

However, the `boardRepresentation()` method is awful, take a look at this line:

```java
buf.append(loc.current.representation.substring(0, 1));
```

It accesses a `Location`, then its current `Piece`, then the `Piece`'s
representation on which it performs an action. This is far from _One Dot Per
Line_.

Fortunately, the [Law of Demeter](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LawOfDemeter) tells you
to talk to your friends, so let's do that:

```java
class Location {
    private Piece current;

    public void addTo(StringBuilder buf) {
        current.addTo(buf);
    }
}
```

Making the instance of `Piece` **private** ensures that you won't try to do
something bad. However, as you need to perform an action on this attribute, you
need a new method `addTo()`. It is not `Location`'s responsibility to determine
how the `Piece` will be added, so let's ask it:

```java
class Piece {
    private String representation;

    public String character() {
        return representation.substring(0, 1);
    }

    public void addTo(StringBuilder buf) {
        buf.append(character());
    }
}
```

Then again, you should change the visibility of your attribute. As a reminder,
the [Open/Closed Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle)
says that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be **open
for extension**, but **closed for modification**.

Also, extracting the code to get the first character of the `representation`
in a new method looks like a good idea as it may be reused at some point.
Finally, here is the updated `Board` class:

```java
class Board {
    public String boardRepresentation() {
        StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();

        for (Location location : squares()) {
            location.addTo(buf);
        }

        return buf.toString();
    }
}
```

Much better, right?

## 6. Don't Abbreviate

The right question is **Why Do You Want To Abbreviate?**

You may answer that it is because you write the same name over and over again?
And I would answer that this method is reused multiple times, and that it looks
like **code duplication**.

So you will say that the method name is too long anyway. And I would tell you
that maybe your class has multiple responsibilities, which is bad as it violates
the [Single Responsibility
Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).

I often say that if you can't find a decent name for a class or a method,
something is probably wrong. It is a rule I use to follow while [designing a
software by naming things](/2012/01/24/designing-a-software-by-naming-things/).

Don't abbreviate, period.

## 7. Keep All Entities Small

No class over **50 lines** and no package over 10 files. Well, it depends on
you, but I think you could change the number of lines from 50 to 150.

The idea behind this rule is that **long files are harder to read**, harder to
understand, and harder to maintain.

## 8. No Classes With More Than Two Instance Variables

I thought people would yell at me while introducing this rule, but it didn't
happen. This rule is probably the hardest one, but it promotes **high cohesion**,
and **better encapsulation**.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so here is the explanation of this rule in
picture. Note that it relies on [Rule 3: Wrap All Primitives And
Strings](#3-wrap-all-primitives-and-strings).

![](/images/posts/2013/06/2-instance-variables.png)

<small class="source">Source: [https://github.com/TheLadders/object-calisthenics#rule-8-no-classes-with-more-than-two-instance-variables](https://github.com/TheLadders/object-calisthenics#rule-8-no-classes-with-more-than-two-instance-variables).</small>

The main question was _Why two attributes?_ My answer was _Why not?_ Not the
best explanation but, in my opinion, the main idea is to distinguish **two kinds
of classes**, those that **maintain the state of a single instance variable**,
and those that **coordinate two separate variables**. **Two** is an arbitrary
choice that forces you to decouple your classes a lot.

## 9. No Getters/Setters/Properties

My favorite rule. It could be rephrased as
[Tell](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TellDontAsk), [don't
ask](http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask).

It is okay to use accessors to get the state of an object, as long as you don't
use the result to make decisions outside the object. Any decisions based
entirely upon the state of one object should be made inside the object itself.

That is why [getters/setters are often considered
evil](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/565095/are-getters-and-setters-evil).
Then again, they violate the [Open/Closed
Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle).

Let's take an example:

```java
// Game
private int score;

public void setScore(int score) {
    this.score = score;
}

public int getScore() {
    return score;
}

// Usage
game.setScore(game.getScore() + ENEMY_DESTROYED_SCORE);
```

In the code above, the `getScore()` is used to make a decision, you choose how
to increase your score, instead of leaving this responsibility to the `Game`
instance.

A better solution would be to remove the getters/setters, and to provide methods
that make sense. Remember, you must **tell** the class to do something, and you
should **not ask** it. In the following, you **tell** the `game` to update your
score as you destroyed `ENEMY_DESTROYED_SCORE` enemies.

```java
// Game
public void addScore(int delta) {
    score += delta;
}

// Usage
game.addScore(ENEMY_DESTROYED_SCORE);
```

It is `game`'s responsibility to determine how to update the score.

In this case, you could keep the `getScore()` as you may want to display it
somewhere on the UI, but keep in mind that [setters should not be
allowed](http://whitewashing.de/2012/08/22/building_an_object_model__no_setters_allowed.html).

## Conclusion

If you don't feel comfortable with these rules, it is ok, but trust me when I
tell you that they can be used in real life. Try them in your spare time, by
refactoring your Open Source projects for instance. I think it is just a matter
of practice. Some rules are easy to follow, and may help you.
