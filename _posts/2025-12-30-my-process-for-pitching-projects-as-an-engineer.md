_This winter break has finally given me the mental space I needed, so I wrote
another work-related article this month[^1], yay! This time, I'll focus on my
personal process for pitching projects as an engineer._

[^1]: The <a href="{% post_url 2025-12-24-you-can-lead-a-horse-to-water-but-you-cant-force-it-to-drink %}">previous article</a>
      covered some challenges as a tech lead.

Ever had a great idea at work but struggled to get it on the roadmap? As an
engineer in an environment where product work is primarily driven by product
managers, I've learned how to turn ideas into team priorities. The good thing
is: there is no need to be a lead engineer for that!

## From idea to proposal

Every project starts with an idea aimed at solving a specific problem[^2].
Focusing on small, self-contained problems is much easier than tackling
something that spans the entire product or system. Addressing larger problems
becomes easier with experience and practice.

[^2]: A few concrete examples in no particular order: porting a feature to a
      different platform, sunsetting a service, building an in-house feature to
      replace a third-party application.

I mainly do some research and talk to people. Sometimes, as an engineer who
enjoys coding, I might also do some initial "hacking" to explore the idea and
uncover potential issues. Though not strictly necessary, I find this helpful for
uncovering technical blockers (I also love making cool demos 🙈).

The goal of this phase is to move the idea from a vague notion to a solid,
credible solution for a well-defined problem. From experience, neglecting this
step often leads to a half-baked proposal that lacks clarity and fails to gain
traction.

## Gaining initial buy-in

My strategy for socializing and building support for an idea usually involves
three groups: my peers, my Product Manager (PM), and my manager. I typically
move from peers up to my manager, adjusting my approach based on the feedback I
receive along the way. This iterative feedback process is essential to me. It
stress-tests the idea and maximizes my chances of success, even if the initial
concept requires significant revision.

I aim to convince one or two peers. The burden of proof is entirely on me to
sell the idea, which is why the previous step is so important. When the idea
moves to the broader team or to the PM, having a peer vouch for its value shifts
the dynamic from one person's suggestion to a team-vetted proposal.

Once I have peer buy-in, I start a conversation with the PM. Product Managers
are focused on business value, not engineering details. They usually need
answers to the following questions:

- What is the value added?
- Why should this be prioritized now?
- What is the estimated time to production?

I've found that a concise document[^3] outlining the final state and answering
these specific questions works best for engaging the PM. This is convenient
because it's the same format I use when approaching my peers, so I usually keep
the same _living_ document.

[^3]: Such a document is often referred to as a "1-pager" even if its length
      can exceed a single page.

## Securing manager approval

Once I have my peers and product manager on board, I approach my manager to
discuss planning. In collaboration with the PM, my manager ultimately owns the
team's roadmap.

This isn't the first time my manager hears about the idea, though. I maintain a
proactive communication strategy, ensuring I give them a heads-up about
developing ideas and significant technical explorations early. This prevents my
manager from being caught off guard or, worse, hearing about a developing
initiative secondhand from other stakeholders. It also allows them to provide
early, high-level strategic guidance that might steer the proposal in a more
productive direction before significant effort is invested.

The aim is to engage them at the right time: early for awareness and strategic
input, and formally when a well-supported, high-quality proposal is ready for
definitive planning and commitment.

## Final thoughts

This is my approach to increase the chances of a project to make it onto our
roadmap. Do note that this approach won't always succeed. Ideas are sometimes
rejected, and that's okay.

With that said, I'd encourage interested folks to come up with what works for
them, but that's probably a safe start. If you're one of them, remember that
likely no one will care more than you do, so don't drop the ball!
