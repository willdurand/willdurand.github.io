In 5 hours, a new year will start, 2014. But let’s take a look at 2013 first.

I wrote 15 articles, including this one—this is fewer than the previous year
(18), even though one of my goals for 2013 was to blog more. However, more than
70,000 unique visitors read my thoughts. That’s amazing! Even better, on
Tuesday, July 30, 2013—the publication date of [From STUPID to SOLID
Code!](/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/)–this website attracted over 6,000
unique visitors.

The three most viewed posts were:

- [From STUPID to SOLID Code!](/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/) (20,652
  views)
- [On Open Sourcing Libraries](/2013/07/04/on-open-sourcing-libraries/) (11,779
  views)
- [DDD with Symfony2: Folder Structure and Code
  First](/2013/08/07/ddd-with-symfony2-folder-structure-and-code-first/) (9,035
  views)

It is worth mentioning that [REST APIs with Symfony2: The Right
Way](/2012/08/02/rest-apis-with-symfony2-the-right-way/) received 59,723 unique
visitors this year—even though the article was written in 2012.

These three blog posts explore Open Source and web development topics. Today, I
must confess that I am not a PHP/web developer, I am not even a developer. I am
a PhD student. My daily job is related to industrial computing and software
testing. I don't do programming, and if I would have to, I would use C#/.NET.

During events like SymfonyCon Warsaw, I have encountered individuals who find it
challenging to understand why I contribute so much to Open Source projects. I
engage in such contributions during my spare time purely out of curiosity, and
it's pretty addictive too. But apart from that, I am not too sure what I should
be replying. Like, who would do that otherwise? Not everyone is allowed to do
Open Source at work, and Open Source relies a lot on enthusiasts/hobbyists. I am
certainly not the only person who contributes to Open Source for fun.

Talking about Open Source, [Geocoder](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder)
reached 1200+ stargazers, while
[Negotiation](https://github.com/willdurand/Negotiation) has been installed more
than 116,000 times, and
[BazingaJsTranslationBundle](https://github.com/willdurand/BazingaJsTranslationBundle)
has been installed more than 77,000 times. This means that
BazingaJsTranslationBundle is my most-used Symfony bundle under my GitHub
account ("my" most used bundle would actually be
[FOSJsRoutingBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSJsRoutingBundle)).
My next most-installed project is probably
[JsonpCallbackValidator](https://github.com/willdurand/JsonpCallbackValidator).
Also, [Anchorify.js](https://github.com/willdurand/anchorify.js) remains my
most-starred JavaScript library.

According to this [list](https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/2657075), I am the
47th most active GitHub user. _Cool story, bro!_ Anyway, all this Open Source
work takes time and energy. So, next time you wonder why I’m doing all of this
without being rewarded or without using it myself, please don’t ask :)

I’m rewarded every single day. Most of the time because people use my stuff, and
sometimes, they even appreciate it! I receive emails or tweets with heartfelt
messages weekly. This is incredibly gratifying and truly rewarding! This year, I
even shared my Amazon Wish List on Twitter, and I had the pleasure of receiving
gifts for Christmas:

In no particular order, I would like to thank @pborreli, @weaverryan,
@leannapelham, @lsmith, @mathiasverraes, @toin0u and @youb_s for these awesome
gifts!

I know that money in Open Source is always a tricky topic. Be sure that I won't
get paid twice for the Open Source work I am doing. I am not sponsored by
anyone, and over the last three years, I’ve never asked for compensation. I
don't need money to create new projects or to maintain them. However, domain
names, GitHub account, etc. aren’t free ;-)

Next year, I plan to continue my Open Source contributions and explore new
opportunities for growth. While I have exciting ideas for improving REST support
in PHP/Symfony, I also want to expand my knowledge into new programming
languages. Why not share what I learned with a new community? Who knows where it
might lead? Additionally, I have a number of books to read and am committed to
writing thoughtful reviews for each one.

On a personal plan, I lost 15 kilograms in 2013. This was part of my new
lifestyle changes. I stopped drinking alcohol. I'm also getting into
[flexitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-vegetarianism). I feel much
better now and enjoy a more balanced diet. My fitness routine includes running,
mountain biking, squash, and soccer.

I have three goals for 2014:

- run 10 kilometers in under 40 minutes
- swim faster and improve endurance (~2 km)
- compete in a triathlon

Other goals include:

- reading more books
- writing more, possibly authoring a book
- speaking at conferences
- improving my English
- dominating the world[^1]

Wishing you a Happy New Year. Best wishes for your family and yourself! I look
forward to seeing you next year!

Thank you &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;
